# Three-body-problem
Three-body problem Python simulation app, based on swarm optimization algorithms. 

> **Caution:** This project is still in development. More specific documentation will be added in the future. New functionalities are in their way as well!

This app uses three swarm optimization algorithms to find the initial states of the satelites in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP):
- Particle Swarm Optimization,
- Two-stage Particle Swarm Optimization (my own approach),
- Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm.

It allows the user to choose the algorithm, set the parameters, and visualize the results.
